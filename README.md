# Voron Zero Light X

The release of my custom X axis beam for the Voron 0/0.1 printer.

This mod was designed to provide an easy way to have a lighter X carriage at a low price. It achieves that buy using cheap aluminum bar instead of pocketed aluminum tube.

## Instructions

### 1. Tap Plate and Ensure Tolerances

Tap the middle 10 holes for M2

and make sure that you can slide a M3 bolt through the outer 4 holes (2 on either side), if not, drill out with 3mm drill bit. It should be a light interference fit to reduce play between the spacer and the plate.
